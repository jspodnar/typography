<h1>Typography 5.0 Sample Page</h1>

<h2>What Does The Typography Script Do?</h2>
<p class="typography lines">The Typography script is a JavaScript object that automatically determines ideal font size, leading, and line length to maximize readibility. It applies a default configuration to the <html> element, and can be overwritten as required. It also applies orphan control, and has a "smart quotes feature."</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<ol>
<li>It determines the best font size based on your screen resolution and ideal reading distance.</li>
<li>Then, it calculates ideal line length, leading, and paragraph spacing of text elements based on the ideal font size.</li>
<li>Finally, it applies non-breaking spaces to words that shouldn't be broken up, such as immediately before and after punctuation, and before a sentence ends.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
<p>Apply the "typography" class to the [html] tag to apply the ideal font size to your page. This class can also be applied to individual copy tags (h1-h6, p, td, li) before applying "lines", "orphans", and "quotes" classes.</p>

<p>"lines", "orphans", and "quotes" control classes can be added either to the [html] tag for universal application, or to any other element that you want to apply these controls to.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
