<h1>TypeSet 4.0 Sample Page</h1>

<h2>What is TypeSet?</h2>
<p class="typeset">TypeSet is a JavaScript Object that automatically typesets your page for ideal font size, leading, and line length. It's intent is to set base body copy configuration that maximizes readibility, while at the same time allows you to override as required.</p>

<h3>How does it do that?</h3>
<ol>
<li>First: It determines your screen resolution.</li>
<li>From there, it determines what an ideal Field of View is for 1&ndash;4 characters, and set the font size accordingly.</li>
<li>At the same time, it will also determine the default font size your device has set. If your font size is larger than the calculation TypeSet has determined, it will your your preference instead.</li>
</ol>

<p>From there, TypeSet will calculate ideal length and leading based on the base body copy size, and set that also.</p>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>

<p>Apply the "typeset" class to the body tag to apply typesetting to your page. Override TypeSet settings with your own CSS as required.</p>
